            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Lead is a chemical element with the symbol <strong>Pb</strong> (from Latin "plumbum") and atomic number 82. It is a dense, soft, and dull-gray post-transition metal in Group 14 of the periodic table, positioned between thallium and bismuth. One of the most abundant heavy elements, lead occurs in the Earth’s crust at about 0.0013% by weight, primarily in the mineral galena (PbS).
            </p>
            <p>
                Known since ancient times, lead’s malleability, low melting point, and corrosion resistance made it a staple in construction, plumbing, and early industry. However, its toxicity has curtailed many traditional uses, shifting its role to specialized applications like batteries and radiation shielding.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Isotopes</h2>
            <p>
                Lead has 38 known isotopes, with mass numbers ranging from 178 to 215. Four are stable and naturally occurring—<sup>204</sup>Pb, <sup>206</sup>Pb, <sup>207</sup>Pb, and <sup>208</sup>Pb—while others are radioactive.
            </p>
            <h3>Stable Isotopes</h3>
            <p>
                <sup>208</sup>Pb (52.4% abundance) is the most common, followed by <sup>206</sup>Pb (24.1%), <sup>207</sup>Pb (22.1%), and <sup>204</sup>Pb (1.4%). These isotopes result from the decay of uranium and thorium, making lead a radiogenic element.
            </p>
            <h3>Radioactive Isotopes</h3>
            <p>
                <sup>210</sup>Pb (half-life: 22.3 years) is a significant radioactive isotope in the uranium-238 decay chain, decaying via beta emission into <sup>210</sup>Bi. It’s used in environmental tracing. Other isotopes, like <sup>212</sup>Pb (half-life: 10.6 hours), are studied in nuclear physics.
            </p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>
                Lead is a bluish-gray metal with a dull finish, highly malleable and ductile. It resists corrosion due to a protective oxide layer but is prone to tarnishing in moist air.
            </p>
            <h3>Physical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Lead has a density of 11.34 g/cm³, a melting point of 327.5°C (621.5°F), and a boiling point of 1749°C (3180°F). Its face-centered cubic structure contributes to its softness and workability.
            </p>
            <h3>Chemical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                With an electronegativity of 2.33 (Pauling scale) and a first ionization energy of 7.42 eV, lead commonly exhibits +2 (Pb²⁺) and +4 (Pb⁴⁺) oxidation states, forming compounds like PbO and PbO₂. It reacts with acids (e.g., Pb + 2HNO₃ → Pb(NO₃)₂ + H₂) but is inert to dilute bases.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Lead’s long history reflects its utility and, later, its hazards, shaping both ancient technology and modern regulation.
            </p>
            <h3>Early Uses</h3>
            <p>
                Lead was used by 4000 BCE in Mesopotamia for ornaments and weights. The Romans exploited it extensively for pipes, aqueducts, and wine vessels (plumbum), with production peaking at 80,000 tons annually by 100 CE.
            </p>
            <h3>Subsequent Developments</h3>
            <p>
                In the Middle Ages, lead found use in roofing and stained glass. The 19th century saw its rise in batteries and paint, but recognition of its toxicity in the 20th century led to bans on leaded gasoline and paint in many countries.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>Lead’s density and malleability drive its modern uses:</p>
            <h4>1. Batteries</h4>
            <p>Lead-acid batteries power vehicles and backup systems, leveraging Pb and PbO₂ electrodes.</p>
            <h4>2. Radiation Shielding</h4>
            <p>Lead’s high density blocks X-rays and gamma rays in medical and nuclear settings (e.g., aprons, shields).</p>
            <h4>3. Construction</h4>
            <p>Lead sheets line roofs and soundproof walls, though its use has declined due to health concerns.</p>
            <h4>4. Ammunition</h4>
            <p>Lead’s weight and softness make it ideal for bullets and shot, though alternatives are emerging.</p>
            <h4>5. Pigments</h4>
            <p>Historically used in paints (e.g., lead white), now restricted but still found in some industrial coatings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Lead in the Universe</h2>
            <p>
                Lead forms via slow neutron capture (s-process) in stars and as a decay product of uranium and thorium. Its cosmic abundance is about 1 × 10⁻⁶ relative to hydrogen. On Earth, it accumulates in ores from radiogenic processes.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Modern Production</h2>
            <p>
                Lead is extracted from galena via smelting, with roasting (PbS → PbO) followed by reduction. Global production is around 4.5 million tons annually, led by China, Australia, and the U.S., with significant recycling from batteries.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Safety</h2>
            <p>
                Lead is highly toxic, causing neurological damage, especially in children (e.g., lead poisoning from paint chips). Inhalation or ingestion of dust or fumes poses risks; protective measures are essential in handling.
            </p>
            <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
            <p>
                Lead mining and smelting release pollutants, contaminating soil and water. Leaded gasoline residues persist, though recycling and regulations (e.g., U.S. Clean Air Act) have reduced exposure.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Lead’s legacy is a duality of utility and peril, from Roman pipes to modern batteries. Its enduring presence in industry is tempered by its toxicity, driving innovation in safer alternatives while underscoring the need for responsible stewardship.
