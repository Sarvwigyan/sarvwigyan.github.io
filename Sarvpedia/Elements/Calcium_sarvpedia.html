            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Calcium is a chemical element with the symbol <strong>Ca</strong> and atomic number 20. It is an alkaline earth metal that is essential for living organisms, particularly in cell physiology. Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the universe by mass and is primarily found in the form of compounds, such as calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate. It plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and blood clotting.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Discovery and History</h2>
            <p>
                Calcium was discovered in 1808 by the British chemist Sir Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of lime (calcium oxide). Davy recognized calcium as a distinct element and named it after the Latin word "calx," meaning "lime." The discovery of calcium was significant in the study of alkaline earth metals and their properties. Calcium was isolated in its metallic form in 1890 by the chemist Robert Bunsen and his assistant Augustus Matthiessen.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Isotopes</h2>
            <p>
                Calcium has several isotopes, with <sup>40</sup>Ca being the most abundant, making up about 96.941% of natural calcium. Other isotopes include <sup>42</sup>Ca, <sup>43</sup>Ca, <sup>44</sup>Ca, <sup>46</sup>Ca, and <sup>48</sup>Ca. The isotopes of calcium are used in various applications, including nuclear research and medical imaging. Calcium-47, for example, is used in studies of bone metabolism.

            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>
                Calcium is a soft, silvery-white metal that is relatively reactive, especially with water. It has a melting point of 842°C (1548°F) and a boiling point of 1484°C (2703°F). Calcium has a density of 1.55 g/cm³ and is known for its ability to form a variety of compounds, including calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), calcium sulfate (CaSO₄), and calcium phosphate (Ca₃(PO₄)₂). Calcium exhibits oxidation states of +2, which is the most stable and common state in its compounds.
