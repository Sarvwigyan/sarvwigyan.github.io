            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Tennessine is a chemical element with the symbol <strong>Ts</strong> and atomic number 117. It is a synthetic element and is classified as a halogen. Tennessine is highly radioactive and is one of the heaviest elements currently known. It was first synthesized in 2010 by a team of Russian and American scientists.
            </p>
            <p>
                The element is named after the state of Tennessee, in recognition of the contributions of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the University of Tennessee, and the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education to the discovery of superheavy elements.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Isotopes</h2>
            <p>
                Tennessine has no stable isotopes. The most stable known isotope is <sup>294</sup>Ts, which has a half-life of about 20 milliseconds. Due to its short half-life, tennessine is primarily of interest for research purposes and has no significant applications outside of scientific study.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>
                As a member of the halogen group, tennessine is expected to exhibit properties similar to those of other halogens, such as iodine. However, due to its short half-life and the difficulty of producing it, its physical and chemical properties are not well characterized.
            </p>
            <h3>Physical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Tennessine is predicted to be a solid at room temperature, with a density estimated to be higher than that of astatine. Its melting and boiling points are not well defined due to the limited amount of material available for study.
            </p>
            <h3>Chemical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Tennessine is expected to behave similarly to other halogens, particularly iodine, but its exact chemical behavior remains largely unknown. It is predicted to form compounds with metals and nonmetals, but these compounds have not yet been synthesized.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Tennessine was first synthesized in 2010 by a collaboration between Russian and American scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA. The discovery was confirmed through experiments that produced the element by bombarding californium with calcium ions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>Due to its extreme radioactivity and short half-life, tennessine has no practical applications outside of scientific research. Its primary significance lies in the study of superheavy elements and the exploration of the limits of the periodic table.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Tennessine in the Universe</h2>
            <p>
                Tennessine is not found naturally in the universe due to its instability and short half-life. It is synthesized in laboratories and is primarily of interest for research into the properties of superheavy elements.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Modern Production</h2>
            <p>
                Tennessine is produced in particle accelerators through the fusion of lighter atomic nuclei. The production of tennessine is a complex process that requires advanced technology and significant resources, making it a rare element.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Safety</h2>
            <p>
                Due to its radioactivity, tennessine poses health risks similar to those of other radioactive elements. However, because it is produced in extremely small quantities and has a very short half-life, there is currently no significant risk associated with its handling.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Tennessine is a fascinating element that contributes to our understanding of the periodic table and the behavior of superheavy elements. As research continues, scientists hope to learn more about its properties and potential applications.
