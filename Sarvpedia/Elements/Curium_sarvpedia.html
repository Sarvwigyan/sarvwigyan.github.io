            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Curium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol <strong>Cm</strong> and atomic number 96. It is a hard, dense, and silvery actinide metal, belonging to the actinide series in the periodic table, positioned between americium and berkelium. Named after Marie and Pierre Curie, pioneers of radioactivity research, curium is highly radioactive and does not occur naturally on Earth. It is produced artificially in nuclear reactors or particle accelerators via neutron bombardment of lighter actinides like plutonium.
            </p>
            <p>
                Discovered during World War II as part of the Manhattan Project, curium’s intense radioactivity and alpha-particle emission make it valuable in specialized applications, such as powering space probes. However, its scarcity, short half-lives, and radiological hazards limit its use and require stringent handling protocols.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Isotopes</h2>
            <p>
                Curium has 20 known isotopes, with mass numbers ranging from 233 to 252. All are radioactive, with no stable isotopes. The most significant isotopes include <sup>242</sup>Cm, <sup>244</sup>Cm, and <sup>248</sup>Cm, each with distinct half-lives and decay modes.
            </p>
            <h3>Isotope: <sup>242</sup>Cm</h3>
            <p>
                <sup>242</sup>Cm has a half-life of 162.8 days and decays by alpha emission into <sup>238</sup>Pu. It is produced in significant quantities in nuclear reactors and used in early studies of actinide chemistry.
            </p>
            <h3>Isotope: <sup>244</sup>Cm</h3>
            <p>
                <sup>244</sup>Cm, with a half-life of 18.1 years, is the most commonly studied isotope. It emits alpha particles and is a key power source for radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) in space missions.
            </p>
            <h3>Isotope: <sup>248</sup>Cm</h3>
            <p>
                <sup>248</sup>Cm has a longer half-life of 348,000 years, decaying via alpha emission. Its longevity makes it useful in research, though it is produced in trace amounts.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>
                Curium is a silvery, metallic element that glows faintly in the dark due to its intense radioactivity. It tarnishes in air and is chemically reactive, forming compounds similar to other actinides.
            </p>
            <h3>Physical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Curium has a density of approximately 13.51 g/cm³, a melting point of 1340°C (2444°F), and a boiling point estimated at 3110°C (5630°F). Its hexagonal close-packed structure resembles that of other actinides.
            </p>
            <h3>Chemical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                With an electronegativity of 1.3 (Pauling scale) and a first ionization energy of about 5.99 eV, curium typically exhibits a +3 oxidation state (Cm³⁺) in compounds like Cm₂O₃ or CmCl₃, though +4 (Cm⁴⁺) is possible in some fluorides. It reacts with oxygen, halogens, and acids but is unstable in water due to radiolysis.
            </p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Curium’s discovery marked a milestone in nuclear science, expanding humanity’s understanding of synthetic elements.
            </p>
            <h3>The Discovery</h3>
            <p>
                Curium was first synthesized in 1944 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso at the University of California, Berkeley, during the Manhattan Project. They bombarded <sup>239</sup>Pu with alpha particles in a cyclotron, producing <sup>242</sup>Cm. It was named in honor of Marie and Pierre Curie for their groundbreaking work on radioactivity.
            </p>
            <h3>Subsequent Developments</h3>
            <p>
                Identified via its radioactive signature (not visually, due to its minute quantities), curium was later isolated in weighable amounts in 1947. Its use in space exploration began in the 1960s, powering missions like the Mars Curiosity rover via <sup>244</sup>Cm-based RTGs.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>Curium’s intense radioactivity drives its niche but critical uses:</p>
            <h4>1. Space Power Systems</h4>
            <p><sup>244</sup>Cm generates heat through alpha decay, powering radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) for deep-space probes and rovers where solar power is insufficient.</p>
            <h4>2. Scientific Research</h4>
            <p>Curium isotopes serve as alpha-particle sources in spectrometry and actinide chemistry studies, aiding the synthesis of heavier elements like californium.</p>
            <h4>3. Medical Research</h4>
            <p>Trace amounts of curium have been explored in radiotherapy research, though its high cost and hazard limit practical use.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Curium in the Universe</h2>
            <p>
                Curium is not naturally abundant in the universe due to its short half-lives. Trace amounts may form in supernovae via rapid neutron capture (r-process), but they decay quickly into lighter elements. On Earth, curium exists only as a synthetic product of nuclear reactions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Modern Production</h2>
            <p>
                Curium is produced in nuclear reactors by successive neutron capture starting with <sup>238</sup>U or <sup>239</sup>Pu, yielding isotopes like <sup>244</sup>Cm after beta decays (e.g., <sup>243</sup>Am + n → <sup>244</sup>Am → <sup>244</sup>Cm). Annual production is limited to grams or milligrams, primarily in facilities like Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the U.S. or Russia’s Mayak plant.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Safety</h2>
            <p>
                Curium’s intense alpha, beta, and gamma radiation poses severe health risks, including cancer and organ damage upon inhalation or ingestion. It requires shielded containment and remote handling. Its heat generation (e.g., <sup>244</sup>Cm produces ~3 W/g) complicates storage.
            </p>
            <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
            <p>
                Curium from nuclear waste or accidents could contaminate soil and water, persisting due to isotopes like <sup>248</sup>Cm. Disposal in deep geological repositories is the primary mitigation strategy.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Curium embodies the paradox of nuclear science: a synthetic marvel with potent energy, yet a radiological challenge. From illuminating distant worlds to advancing actinide research, its legacy honors the Curies while underscoring the need for careful stewardship of radioactive elements.
