    <div class="container">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Bromine is a chemical element with the symbol <strong>Br</strong> and atomic number 35. It is a member of the halogen group in the periodic table and is known for its reddish-brown liquid state at room temperature. Bromine is unique among the halogens as it is the only one that is a liquid under standard conditions. It has a distinct, pungent odor and is highly reactive, forming compounds with a wide variety of elements. Bromine is primarily used in industrial applications, including flame retardants, water treatment, and the production of certain pharmaceuticals.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Discovery and History</h2>
            <p>
                Bromine was discovered in 1826 by the French chemist Antoine Jérôme Balard. He isolated it from the residue of saltwater and recognized it as a new element due to its unique properties. The name "bromine" is derived from the Greek word "bromos," meaning "stench," reflecting its strong and unpleasant odor. Balard's discovery was significant as it expanded the understanding of halogens and their chemical behavior.
            </p>
            <h3>Early Uses</h3>
            <p>
                Following its discovery, bromine was initially used in the production of various compounds, including bromides for photography and as a sedative in medicine. Its unique properties made it valuable in a range of applications, leading to increased interest in its chemistry and potential uses.
