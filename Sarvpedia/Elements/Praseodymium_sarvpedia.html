            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Praseodymium is a chemical element with the symbol <strong>Pr</strong> and atomic number 59. It is a soft, silvery-white metal that is part of the lanthanide series of the periodic table. Praseodymium is known for its use in various alloys and as a dopant in certain types of glass and ceramics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The element was discovered in 1885 by Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach, who isolated it from a sample of didymium. The name "praseodymium" is derived from the Greek words "prasios," meaning "green," and "didymos," meaning "twin."
            </p>

            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>
                Praseodymium is a soft, malleable metal that is relatively stable in air. It is known for its bright yellow-green color when oxidized and is often used in various applications due to its unique properties.
            </p>
            <h3>Physical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Praseodymium has a density of 6.77 g/cm³, a melting point of 931°C (1708°F), and a boiling point of 3560°C (6440°F). Its crystalline structure is hexagonal close-packed.
            </p>
            <h3>Chemical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Praseodymium reacts with oxygen to form praseodymium oxide (Pr₂O₃) and can also react with acids to form praseodymium salts. It exhibits oxidation states of +3 and +4, with the +3 state being the most stable.
