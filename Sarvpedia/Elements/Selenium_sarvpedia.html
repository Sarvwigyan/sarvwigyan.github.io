            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Selenium is a chemical element with the symbol <strong>Se</strong> and atomic number 34. It is a non-metal that exists in several allotropes, including a gray metallic form and a red amorphous form. Selenium is known for its photoconductive properties and is used in various applications, including electronics, glassmaking, and as a dietary supplement.
            </p>
            <p>
                The element was discovered in 1817 by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius and his assistant Johan Gottlieb Gahn while they were studying the mineral pyrite. The name "selenium" is derived from the Greek word "selene," meaning "moon," in reference to its connection with tellurium, which is named after the Earth.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Isotopes</h2>
            <p>
                Selenium has several isotopes, with <sup>78</sup>Se, <sup>80</sup>Se, and <sup>82</sup>Se being the most stable and abundant. The average atomic mass of selenium is approximately 78.971 u. Selenium-79 (<sup>79</sup>Se) is a radioactive isotope with a half-life of about 16 million years and is of interest in nuclear waste management.

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>
                Selenium is a non-metal that exhibits properties of both metals and non-metals. It is a brittle, grayish-black solid in its most stable form and can also exist as a red powder.
            </p>
            <h3>Physical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Selenium has a density of 4.81 g/cm³, a melting point of 221°C (430°F), and a boiling point of 685°C (1265°F). Its crystalline structure can vary depending on the allotrope.
            </p>
            <h3>Chemical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Selenium reacts with metals to form selenides and can also react with halogens and sulfur. It exhibits oxidation states of -2, +2, +4, and +6, with the -2 state being the most stable in compounds.
