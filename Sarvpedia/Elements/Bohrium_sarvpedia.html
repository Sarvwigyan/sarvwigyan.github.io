    <div class="container">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Bohrium is a synthetic element with the symbol <strong>Bh</strong> and atomic number 107. It is classified as a transactinide element and is part of the group of elements known as the transition metals. Bohrium is named after the Danish physicist Niels Bohr, who made significant contributions to our understanding of atomic structure and quantum mechanics. As a highly radioactive element, bohrium is not found naturally and must be produced in a laboratory setting through nuclear reactions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Discovery and History</h2>
            <p>
                Bohrium was first synthesized in 1981 by a team of Russian and American scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. The team, led by Yuri Oganessian, bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of chromium-54. This reaction produced the first atoms of bohrium, which were detected through their decay products. The discovery of bohrium was a significant milestone in the field of nuclear chemistry, as it expanded our understanding of heavy elements and their properties.
            </p>
            <h3>Naming and Recognition</h3>
            <p>
                The element was named in honor of Niels Bohr to recognize his contributions to the field of atomic physics. The name was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 1997. Bohrium's discovery and subsequent naming reflect the ongoing efforts to honor the pioneers of science and their impact on our understanding of the atomic world.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Isotopes</h2>
            <p>
                Bohrium has several isotopes, all of which are radioactive. The most stable isotope is <sup>270</sup>Bh, which has a half-life of approximately 61 seconds. Other isotopes include <sup>271</sup>Bh, with a half-life of about 17 seconds, and <sup>272</sup>Bh, which has a half-life of around 1.5 seconds. Due to their short half-lives, these isotopes decay rapidly, primarily through alpha decay, and are challenging to study in detail.
            </p>
            <h3>Production of Isotopes</h3>
            <p>
                The isotopes of bohrium are produced in particle accelerators through nuclear fusion reactions. Typically, a target material, such as bismuth, is bombarded with heavy ions, such as chromium. The resulting fusion reaction creates bohrium atoms, which are then detected through their decay products. The production of bohrium is a complex and resource-intensive process, requiring advanced technology and expertise in nuclear physics.

            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>
                As a synthetic element, bohrium's properties are not as well-characterized as those of more stable elements. However, based on its position in the periodic table and theoretical predictions, several properties can be inferred:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Bohrium is expected to be a metallic element, likely exhibiting a silvery or grayish color similar to other transition metals.</li>
                <li><strong>Density:</strong> The density of bohrium is estimated to be around 37 g/cm³, making it one of the densest elements known.</li>
                <li><strong>Melting and Boiling Points:</strong> The melting and boiling points of bohrium are not well-defined due to its radioactivity, but they are predicted to be high, consistent with other heavy transition metals.</li>
                <li><strong>Oxidation States:</strong> Bohrium is expected to exhibit oxidation states of +3 and +5, similar to other elements in its group.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Theoretical calculations and experimental data from related elements suggest that bohrium may exhibit unique chemical behavior due to relativistic effects, which can influence the properties of heavy elements.
