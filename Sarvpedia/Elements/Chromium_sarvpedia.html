            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Chromium is a chemical element with the symbol <strong>Cr</strong> and atomic number 24. It is a lustrous, hard, and brittle transition metal, belonging to Group 6 of the periodic table, situated between vanadium and manganese. Known for its steely-gray color and exceptional corrosion resistance, chromium is a key component in stainless steel and various alloys. It occurs naturally in the Earth’s crust primarily as chromite ore (FeCr₂O₄), making up about 0.01% of the crust by weight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chromium’s name derives from the Greek "chroma," meaning "color," due to the vivid hues of its compounds, such as the green of chromium(III) oxide or the red of chromates. Discovered in the late 18th century, it has become indispensable in modern industry, from metallurgy to pigments, while its hexavalent form (Cr⁶⁺) raises environmental and health concerns due to its toxicity.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Isotopes</h2>
            <p>
                Chromium has 26 known isotopes, with mass numbers ranging from 42 to 67. Four are stable and naturally occurring—<sup>50</sup>Cr, <sup>52</sup>Cr, <sup>53</sup>Cr, and <sup>54</sup>Cr—while the rest are radioactive. The average atomic mass of chromium is approximately 51.996 u, dominated by <sup>52</sup>Cr.
            </p>
            <h3>Stable Isotope: <sup>52</sup>Cr</h3>
            <p>
                <sup>52</sup>Cr, with 28 neutrons, is the most abundant isotope, comprising 83.79% of natural chromium. Its stability underpins chromium’s widespread use in alloys and industrial applications.
            </p>
            <h3>Other Stable Isotopes</h3>
            <p>
                <sup>50</sup>Cr (4.35%), <sup>53</sup>Cr (9.50%), and <sup>54</sup>Cr (2.36%) occur in smaller amounts. These isotopes are used in isotopic studies, such as tracing geological processes or nuclear reactions.
            </p>
            <h3>Radioactive Isotopes</h3>
            <p>
                <sup>51</sup>Cr (half-life: 27.7 days) is a notable radioactive isotope, used in medical research to label red blood cells and study their lifespan. It decays via electron capture, emitting gamma rays.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>
                Chromium is a shiny, silver-gray metal with a high melting point and remarkable hardness. It resists tarnishing due to a passive oxide layer (Cr₂O₃) that forms naturally on its surface, protecting it from corrosion.
            </p>
            <h3>Physical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Chromium has a density of 7.19 g/cm³, a melting point of 1907°C (3465°F), and a boiling point of 2671°C (4840°F). Its crystalline structure is body-centered cubic, contributing to its strength and brittleness.
            </p>
            <h3>Chemical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                With an electronegativity of 1.66 (Pauling scale) and a first ionization energy of 6.77 eV, chromium exhibits multiple oxidation states, most commonly +2, +3, and +6. The +3 state (Cr³⁺) is stable and prevalent in compounds like Cr₂O₃, while +6 (Cr⁶⁺) in chromates (e.g., CrO₄²⁻) is a strong oxidizer and toxic.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Chromium’s discovery enriched metallurgy and chemistry, highlighting the role of transition metals in industrial progress.
            </p>
            <h3>The Discovery</h3>
            <p>
                Chromium was identified in 1797 by French chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, who isolated it from crocoite (PbCrO₄), a bright red mineral. He named it "chromium" for the colorful compounds it forms. In 1798, he produced pure chromium metal by reducing chromium(III) oxide with charcoal.
            </p>
            <h3>Subsequent Developments</h3>
            <p>
                By the 19th century, chromium’s corrosion resistance led to its use in alloys, notably stainless steel (developed in 1912 by Harry Brearley), transforming construction and manufacturing. Its compounds also became vital in pigments and tanning.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>Chromium’s durability and versatility drive its widespread use:</p>
            <h4>1. Metallurgy</h4>
            <p>Chromium is alloyed with iron to produce stainless steel (10-20% Cr), enhancing strength and corrosion resistance for cutlery, appliances, and infrastructure.</p>
            <h4>2. Plating</h4>
            <p>Chromium electroplating (using Cr⁶⁺ solutions) coats metals with a shiny, protective layer, common in automotive parts and tools.</p>
            <h4>3. Pigments</h4>
            <p>Compounds like chromium(III) oxide (green) and lead chromate (yellow) color paints, ceramics, and plastics.</p>
            <h4>4. Leather Tanning</h4>
            <p>Chromium(III) sulfate tans leather, making it supple and durable.</p>
            <h4>5. Refractories</h4>
            <p>Chromite is used in high-temperature bricks for furnaces and kilns.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Chromium in the Universe</h2>
            <p>
                Chromium forms in stars via silicon burning in supernovae, fusing lighter nuclei into <sup>52</sup>Cr and other isotopes. Its cosmic abundance is about 1.5 × 10⁻⁵ relative to hydrogen, and it is enriched in Earth’s mantle and crust via differentiation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Modern Production</h2>
            <p>
                Chromium is extracted from chromite ore via the aluminothermic process (Cr₂O₃ + 2Al → 2Cr + Al₂O₃) or smelting, producing ferrochrome for steelmaking. Global output exceeds 30 million tons annually, led by South Africa and Kazakhstan.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Safety</h2>
            <p>
                Hexavalent chromium (Cr⁶⁺) is carcinogenic and toxic, causing lung cancer and skin irritation upon exposure. Trivalent chromium (Cr³⁺) is less harmful and an essential trace nutrient in glucose metabolism. Strict regulations govern its industrial use and disposal.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Chromium’s blend of beauty, strength, and utility defines its role in modern life. From gleaming steel to vibrant pigments, it shapes industries, yet its dual nature—beneficial in alloys, hazardous in hexavalent form—demands careful stewardship.
