            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Scandium is a chemical element with the symbol <strong>Sc</strong> and atomic number 21. It is a silvery-white metallic element that is part of the transition metals group. Scandium was discovered in 1879 by Lars Fredrik Nilson while he was studying minerals from Scandinavia.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name "scandium" is derived from "Scandia," the Latin name for Scandinavia. Scandium is known for its lightweight and high-strength properties, making it valuable in various applications, particularly in aerospace and sports equipment.
