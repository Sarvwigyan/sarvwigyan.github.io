            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Sulfur is a chemical element with the symbol <strong>S</strong> and atomic number 16. It is a yellow, brittle solid at room temperature and is known for its distinct smell, especially when burned. Sulfur is an essential element for life and is found in amino acids and vitamins.
            </p>
            <p>
                The element has been known since ancient times and was recognized as a distinct substance by alchemists. The name "sulfur" is derived from the Latin word "sulphurium."
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Isotopes</h2>
            <p>
                Sulfur has several isotopes, with <sup>32</sup>S, <sup>33</sup>S, <sup>34</sup>S, and <sup>36</sup>S being the most stable. The most abundant isotope is <sup>32</sup>S, which makes up about 95% of natural sulfur. The average atomic mass of sulfur is approximately 32.06 u.

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>
                Sulfur is a non-metal that is essential for life. It is a poor conductor of electricity and has a low melting point compared to metals.
            </p>
            <h3>Physical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Sulfur has a density of 2.07 g/cm³, a melting point of 115.21°C (239.38°F), and a boiling point of 444.6°C (832.3°F). Its crystalline structure is orthorhombic.
            </p>
            <h3>Chemical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Sulfur reacts with many elements, including oxygen, hydrogen, and metals, to form various compounds, such as sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S). It exhibits oxidation states of -2, +4, and +6, with the -2 state being the most stable in sulfide compounds.
