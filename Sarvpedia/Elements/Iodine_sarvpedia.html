            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Iodine is a chemical element with the symbol <strong>I</strong> and atomic number 53. It is a dark gray or purple-black solid that is a member of the halogen group in the periodic table. Iodine is essential for the production of thyroid hormones in the human body and is commonly used in various applications, including medicine and photography.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name "iodine" is derived from the Greek word "ioeides," meaning "violet-colored," which refers to the color of iodine vapor. Iodine was discovered in 1811 by French chemist Bernard Courtois while he was extracting sodium from seaweed.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Isotopes</h2>
            <p>
                Iodine has several isotopes, with <sup>127</sup>I being the most stable and abundant. The average atomic mass of iodine is approximately 126.904 u. Iodine-131 (<sup>131</sup>I) is a radioactive isotope used in medical applications, particularly in the treatment of thyroid disorders.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>
                Iodine is a non-metal that exhibits unique properties, including its ability to sublime, meaning it can transition from a solid to a gas without becoming a liquid. It has a characteristic purple vapor and is slightly soluble in water.
            </p>
            <h3>Physical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Iodine has a density of 4.93 g/cm³, a melting point of 113.7°C (236.7°F), and a boiling point of 184.3°C (363.7°F). Its crystalline structure is orthorhombic.
            </p>
            <h3>Chemical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Iodine readily reacts with many elements, including metals and non-metals, to form iodides. It exhibits oxidation states of -1, +1, +3, +5, and +7, with the -1 state being the most common.
