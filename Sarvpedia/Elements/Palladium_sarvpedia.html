            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Palladium is a chemical element with the symbol <strong>Pd</strong> and atomic number 46. It is a rare, precious metal that is part of the platinum group of metals. Palladium is known for its excellent catalytic properties and is widely used in catalytic converters, electronics, and jewelry.
            </p>
            <p>
                The element was discovered in 1803 by English chemist William Hyde Wollaston, who named it after the asteroid Pallas, which was discovered shortly before.

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>
                Palladium is a lustrous, silvery-white metal that is highly resistant to corrosion and oxidation. It is malleable and ductile, making it easy to work with in various applications.
            </p>
            <h3>Physical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Palladium has a density of 12.02 g/cm³, a melting point of 1554°C (2830°F), and a boiling point of 2963°C (5365°F). Its crystalline structure is face-centered cubic.
            </p>
            <h3>Chemical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Palladium is relatively inert and does not react with air or water at room temperature. It can dissolve in concentrated acids and form various palladium compounds. Palladium exhibits oxidation states of +2 and +4, with the +2 state being the most stable.
