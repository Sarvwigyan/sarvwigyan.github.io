            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Radium is a chemical element with the symbol <strong>Ra</strong> and atomic number 88. It is a highly radioactive alkaline earth metal that glows in the dark due to its radioactivity. Radium was discovered in 1898 by Marie Curie and Pierre Curie while they were studying uranium ore.
            </p>
            <p>
                The element was named after the Latin word "radius," meaning "ray," due to its intense radioactivity. Radium was once widely used in various applications, including luminous paints and medical treatments, but its use has declined due to health risks associated with radiation exposure.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Isotopes</h2>
            <p>
                Radium has several isotopes, with <sup>226</sup>Ra being the most stable and significant, having a half-life of about 1600 years. Other isotopes include <sup>223</sup>Ra, <sup>224</sup>Ra, and <sup>225</sup>Ra, each with varying half-lives and properties.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>
                Radium is a silvery-white metal that is highly radioactive and glows faintly in the dark. It is relatively soft and can be cut with a knife. Radium is known for its intense radioactivity and poses significant health risks.
            </p>
            <h3>Physical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Radium has a density of 5.5 g/cm³, a melting point of 700°C (1292°F), and a boiling point of 1413°C (2575°F). Its crystalline structure is face-centered cubic.
            </p>
            <h3>Chemical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Radium reacts vigorously with oxygen and moisture, forming radium oxide (RaO) and other compounds. It exhibits oxidation states of +2, with the +2 state being the most stable.
