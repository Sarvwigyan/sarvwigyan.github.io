        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Hassium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol <strong>Hs</strong> and atomic number 108. It is a member of the group of elements known as the transition metals and is classified as a superheavy element. Hassium was first synthesized in 1984 by a team of German scientists at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany.
            </p>
            <p>
                The element is named after the German state of Hesse, where Darmstadt is located. Due to its short half-life and the difficulty of producing it, Hassium has no significant commercial applications and is primarily of interest for scientific research.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Isotopes</h2>
            <p>
                Hassium has several isotopes, with <sup>277</sup>Hs being the most stable, having a half-life of about 16.5 milliseconds. Other isotopes, such as <sup>276</sup>Hs and <sup>278</sup>Hs, have even shorter half-lives. The isotopes of Hassium are produced in particle accelerators through nuclear reactions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>
                As a synthetic element, Hassium has not been studied extensively, and its properties are not well characterized. However, it is expected to exhibit properties similar to those of osmium and other transition metals.
            </p>
            <h3>Physical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Hassium is predicted to be a solid at room temperature, with a metallic appearance. Its density and melting point are not well established due to the limited amount of material produced.
            </p>
            <h3>Chemical Properties</h3>
            <p>
                Hassium is expected to behave as a heavy metal and may exhibit oxidation states similar to those of osmium, particularly +4 and +6. However, due to its radioactivity and short half-life, chemical studies are challenging.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Hassium was first synthesized on September 12, 1984, by a team of scientists led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg. The element was created by bombarding a target of lead-206 with accelerated iron-58 ions. The discovery was confirmed in subsequent experiments, and the element was officially named Hassium in 1997.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>Due to its extreme radioactivity and short half-life, Hassium has no practical applications outside of scientific research.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Hassium in the Universe</h2>
            <p>
                As a synthetic element, Hassium is not found naturally in the universe. It is produced in laboratories through nuclear reactions and is primarily of interest for research in nuclear physics and chemistry.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Modern Production</h2>
            <p>
                Hassium is produced in particle accelerators by colliding heavy ions with target materials. The production of Hassium is highly complex and requires advanced technology and facilities.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Safety</h2>
            <p>
                Due to its radioactivity, Hassium poses health risks if handled improperly. However, its short half-life means that it decays quickly, limiting exposure. Safety protocols are essential when working with radioactive materials.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Hassium, while not widely known or used, represents the cutting edge of modern chemistry and nuclear physics. Its discovery and study contribute to our understanding of heavy elements and the forces that govern atomic structure.
