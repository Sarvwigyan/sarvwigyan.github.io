The research finds that on short time scales, the relative phase exhibits 'light cone' dynamics, creating a metastable superfluid state. This phenomenon, which suppresses vortex proliferation, is identified as a reverse-Kibble-Zurek effect. The study uses both numerical methods (truncated Wigner approximation) and an analytical time-dependent renormalization group approach (RG) to analyze the relaxation of the supercritical state to a disordered state via dynamical vortex unbinding. The RG approach suggests a non-equilibrium Kosterlitz-Thouless type phase transition.",

The paper also reports a swap in the spatial distributions of two occupied and two empty subbands close to the Fermi level under different strains. The tunable gap width is shown to narrow as the width of the AGNRs increases.

    "longDesc": "This theoretical paper, conducted at the **B3LYP level of theory**, predicts that **half-metallicity** can be induced in a **zigzag edge graphene nanoribbon (ZGNR)** by applying an **external electric field** across the ribbon. Key findings show that the **critical electric field** required to realize half-metallicity decreases as the ribbon's width increases. The research also reveals that under very strong electric fields, the spin polarization and half-metallicity are removed when the edge state electrons fully transfer from one side to the other. Conversely, the useful electric field range for which the ZGNR remains half-metallic increases with the ribbon width. This rich field-induced **spin polarization** behavior suggests important applications in the field of **spintronics**.",

    "longDesc": "This paper presents an updated review of **Lorentz invariance tests** within **Effective Field Theories (EFT)**, covering both the matter and gravity sectors. Following a general discussion of Lorentz invariance and its derivation via the **von Ignatovski theorem**, the review details the dynamical frameworks developed in local EFT. It summarizes the available experimental and observational constraints on the parameters that govern **Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV)** effects. The paper discusses two specific examples: the **OPERA 'affaire'** (a potential observation of superluminal neutrinos, serving as a case study and a caveat for applying LIV constraints), and the theoretical framework of **Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity**, showing how these techniques apply to specific quantum gravity scenarios.",

The spin-flop is a field-driven **first-order reorientation transition** where the sub-lattice magnetizations 'flop' away from the easy axis. The theory shows that the hierarchy of magnetic coupling strengths results in a strong **two-scale character** in the magnetic phase structure. Near the spin-flop region, the antiferromagnets can be described by an effective model similar to uniaxial ferromagnets, provided that **higher-order anisotropy** and **dipolar stray-fields** are included. Crucially, the authors show that **thermodynamically stable multidomain states** exist in the spin-flop region due to the **phase coexistence** at this first-order transition. The paper derives the equilibrium spin-configurations and parameters for these multidomain states. Anomalies in the calculated **magnetic susceptibility tensor** components are proposed as an efficient method to investigate magnetic states and determine material parameters in bulk, confined, and nanoscale synthetic antiferromagnets. This method is demonstrated using experimental data for the layered antiferromagnet **(C_2H_5NH_3)_2CuCl_4**.",

The strips are characterized by opposite net currents and analyzed under the assumption of **critical-state theory**. The strips have thickness $d$, width $2a >> d$, and arbitrary separation $D$. The author derives expressions for the **AC losses** due to magnetic-flux penetration from both the strip edges and the top/bottom surfaces. The results are expressed in terms of integrals involving the perpendicular and parallel components of the magnetic field. After numerical evaluation for typical dimensions, the paper provides simplified **analytic expressions** that can be used to estimate these losses, which is critical for the design of superconducting devices.",

As the compound approaches the trivial phase (at $x_c$ approximately 0.25), the Dirac cones are shown to **gradually move toward the Xbar point** while their spectral weight decreases. For samples with $x \\le 0.2$, the Dirac-cone surface state vanishes completely, confirming the phase transition. The evolution of the valence band is consistent with the **bulk band inversion** occurring at $x_c$.

Specifically, the authors analyze a new **'dark' vector state $V$** (a massive vector boson, or **dark photon**) that mixes with the photon via an angle $\\kappa$. For small mass $m_V$, the dark photon's emission spectrum is strongly peaked at low energies. The study utilizes constraints on the atomic ionization rate from the **XENON10 experiment** (a low-threshold **Dark Matter detector**) to set the limit on the model parameters: $\\kappa \\cdot m_V < 3 \\times 10^{-12}$ eV. This demonstrates that low-threshold Dark Matter experiments function as the **most sensitive dark vector helioscopes**.

    "longDesc": "This paper discusses how **surface gravity** can be **classically defined** for **dynamical black holes**. The focus is on defining surface gravity for **locally defined horizons**, and the authors compare several definitions that have been proposed in the literature. They illustrate the differences between these various proposals using the case of an **arbitrary dynamical, spherically symmetric black hole spacetime**. The paper also discusses the relationship between the **trapping horizon formalism** developed by Hayward and other existing constructions for defining gravitational properties of non-static black holes.",
